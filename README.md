TreeMaker
=========

A library for making and using general tree data structures.  Utilizes iterator style "crawlers" for easy traversal of the tree patterns.  Individual Nodes hold data declared simply as an Object for the moment.

TODO: Removal functions on the crawlers.  Multiple methods for adding children and more!

NOTES: Decided to not do an In-order crawler as it is only applicable to a binary tree and this is more generic.
